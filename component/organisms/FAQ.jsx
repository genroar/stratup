                child="Yes – Strat Up takes authenticity seriously. All of our timepieces are inspected under high magnification for any potential signs of fraudulent pieces or parts by our in-house Swiss-trained watchmakers before they are listed on our platform. In addition, all of our sellers must undergo a thorough vetting process before being able to list on our platform. We also work closely with watch brands via a Certified Pre-Owned programme, where the watches have been authenticated by the brands themselves."
